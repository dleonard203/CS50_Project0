# Project 0

This project's goal is to build a website about one of your passions using HTML, Sass, and CSS. I chose to write a blog about programming, and to write a little bit about some of my favorite tools. I'm a back-end programmer for a living, and am using this class to learn about front-end web development to help me build flask applications for internal use.
