        <p>I'm a software engineer, coding mainly in Python. I was challenged to learn Flask to put together my first full-stack application, and found
            out how much fun web development can be in the process. Sure, there are frustrating times where the button just won't go below the image,
            but at the end of the day, the problem solving is what makes programming a joy in the first place.

            On the top banner, I have included links to some of my favorite tools, as well as a few jokes. Check back often for updates!

            Below, is a table containing my favorite types of tables

                <td>picnic</td>
